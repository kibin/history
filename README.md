# Motorcycle History Driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/motorcyclejs/history.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/motorcyclejs/history)

This is the standard Cycle driver for dealing with the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).

This project builds on top of the battled-tested library [rackt/history](https://github.com/rackt/history), most notably used to create React-Router. The use of this library makes this driver easy to maintain and simplifies the differences between browsers and devices.
